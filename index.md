## Welcome

[Improving](http://improving.com) has chosen to make these resources available
because we firmly believe that the success of our industry will, in the long term,
be driven by our ability to grow talented new developers.  Feel free to use these
tools to further your own learning, but be mindful of the license which all of
these projects are offered under, which restricts commercial use, and requires
any changes or updates you make to be shared back with the community.
